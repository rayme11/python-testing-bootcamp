# Python Testing Bootcamp

Welcome 👋 This is a **step-by-step, day-by-day training bootcamp** where we learn:

- Python basics
- Testing with `pytest`
- Async tests
- FastAPI
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- CI, coverage, and more

## 📖 How to Follow

Each day has its own folder under `days/`.

- Start at [`days/day01`](./days/day01/README.md).
- Each `README.md` explains:
  - Goals for the day
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Code snippets
  - Theory and explanations
  - A summary

By Day 12 we cover **FastAPI + MongoDB + GraphQL** with working tests and coverage reports.

## ▶️ Setup

To bootstrap everything (dependencies, MongoDB, GraphQL server, and project structure):

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
